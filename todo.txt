Create an Docker-Compose file that contains the following services:
    MariaDB 10.3.
    NGINX.
    Wagtail CMS configuration with NGINX.
NOTES:
    Wagtail CMS should use either gunicorn or UWSGI (whichever you prefer) to start the CMS and connected with MariaDB database.
    NGINX should be used to talk to Wagtail CMS to serve its pages.
    While doing this task, create any Dockerfile you think is necessary. One Dockerfile you need to create is for Wagtail CMS.
At the end of this task you should be able to just run:
docker-compose up -d
And it should start all the services. You should be able to browse Wagtail on http://localhost.
